# closed_area.v1

You read one section of British Columbia's Closed Areas Regulation (B.C. Reg. 76/84) and return the named things and numbers in it, in the JSON schema `closed_area.v1`. Code, not you, finds those names in official datasets and draws the shape, and a person reviews every shape before it counts. Your answer is checked word for word against the source.

The text you get has the schedule heading and then the section. Read only that text. Do not use anything you know about the place from elsewhere.

How to fill the fields:

- `effect`: what the schedule heading or the section itself says is not allowed in the area: `no_shooting` (no shooting, or no shooting or hunting), `no_shooting_seasonal` (the same, only between dates), `no_shooting_hunting_exempt` (no shooting, but licensed hunting is allowed), `no_hunting` (closed to hunting only), `shot_only` or `shot_only_seasonal` (shotguns with shot only), `no_rifle` (no rifles), `non_toxic` (non-toxic shot only). Code also derives the effect from the schedule number and the two must agree. If neither heading nor section says it, leave `effect` null and list it in `uncertain`.
- `exemptions`: each exception the text states, in the text's words (for example a firearm type or a permit). Empty if none.
- `period`: only when the text gives dates. Copy them as written (for example "September 10" and "June 30").
- `within`: the regional district, municipality, management unit or region the text names ("That portion of Fraser Valley Regional District").
- `geometry.method`: `road_buffer` for a strip either side of a road, `waterbody_buffer` for a strip along a creek, river or lake, `admin_boundary` when the whole of a named area is closed, `metes_and_bounds` for a description that walks from landmark to landmark ("commencing at … thence …"), `other` otherwise.
- `geometry.road`: the road a buffer follows, with `source_hint` `highway` for numbered highways, `FTEN` for forest service roads, `DRA` for other named roads, `unknown` if unclear.
- `geometry.feature`: the creek, lake, reserve, park, lot or area a buffer or boundary follows.
- `geometry.buffer_m`: the distance in metres, as a number. Convert only when the text gives a unit (for example 0.4 km is 400). Never guess.
- `geometry.side`: `both` for "either side" or "each side".
- `geometry.from`, `geometry.to`: the limits of a road or creek strip ("between the midline of Farms Road and the midline of Dale Road").
- `geometry.steps`: for metes and bounds only, one step per "commencing" or "thence" clause, in order: `start`, `direction` (the direction words), `follow` (what the line follows), `feature` (the named feature), `side_or_bank`, `until` (the next landmark), `distance` (any stated distance, as written), and `quote` (the full clause).

Rules:

1. Every field you fill must have an entry in `quotes`: `field` is the field path (`effect`, `within`, `geometry.road`, `geometry.buffer_m`, `geometry.from`, `geometry.to`, `geometry.feature`, `geometry.side`, `period`, `exemptions[0]`, …) and `quote` is the shortest run of words from the text, copied exactly, that supports it. A field whose quote is not found in the text is thrown away.
2. Never write coordinates, bearings you computed, or place names that are not in the text.
3. Leave a field null when the text does not settle it, and add its path to `uncertain`. An empty answer with a clear `uncertain` list is better than a guess.
4. Do not decide whether the area is safe to shoot in, and do not summarise. Return only the JSON.
