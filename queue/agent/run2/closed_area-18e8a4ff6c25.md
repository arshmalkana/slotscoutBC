# Extraction task closed_area-18e8a4ff6c25 (run 2)

Write your answer to `queue/answers/run2/closed_area-18e8a4ff6c25.json` as:

```json
{ "task_id": "closed_area-18e8a4ff6c25", "run": 2, "mode": "agent", "model": "Claude Code agent mode, fresh subagent", "prompt_version": "closed_area.v1", "schema_id": "closed_area.v1", "produced_at": "<ISO time>", "answer": { ...matching schema/closed_area.v1.json... } }
```

The answer must match `schema/closed_area.v1.json` exactly. Use only the source text below. Never write coordinates. Every filled field needs its exact quote.

## Instructions

# closed_area.v1

You read one section of British Columbia's Closed Areas Regulation (B.C. Reg. 76/84) and return the named things and numbers in it, in the JSON schema `closed_area.v1`. Code, not you, finds those names in official datasets and draws the shape, and a person reviews every shape before it counts. Your answer is checked word for word against the source.

The text you get has the schedule heading and then the section. Read only that text. Do not use anything you know about the place from elsewhere.

How to fill the fields:

- `effect`: what the schedule heading or the section itself says is not allowed in the area: `no_shooting` (no shooting, or no shooting or hunting), `no_shooting_seasonal` (the same, only between dates), `no_shooting_hunting_exempt` (no shooting, but licensed hunting is allowed), `no_hunting` (closed to hunting only), `shot_only` or `shot_only_seasonal` (shotguns with shot only), `no_rifle` (no rifles), `non_toxic` (non-toxic shot only). Code also derives the effect from the schedule number and the two must agree. If neither heading nor section says it, leave `effect` null and list it in `uncertain`.
- `exemptions`: each exception the text states, in the text's words (for example a firearm type or a permit). Empty if none.
- `period`: only when the text gives dates. Copy them as written (for example "September 10" and "June 30").
- `within`: the regional district, municipality, management unit or region the text names ("That portion of Fraser Valley Regional District").
- `geometry.method`: `road_buffer` for a strip either side of a road, `waterbody_buffer` for a strip along a creek, river or lake, `admin_boundary` when the whole of a named area is closed, `metes_and_bounds` for a description that walks from landmark to landmark ("commencing at … thence …"), `other` otherwise.
- `geometry.road`: the road a buffer follows, with `source_hint` `highway` for numbered highways, `FTEN` for forest service roads, `DRA` for other named roads, `unknown` if unclear.
- `geometry.feature`: the creek, lake, reserve, park, lot or area a buffer or boundary follows.
- `geometry.buffer_m`: the distance in metres, as a number. Convert only when the text gives a unit (for example 0.4 km is 400). Never guess.
- `geometry.side`: `both` for "either side" or "each side".
- `geometry.from`, `geometry.to`: the limits of a road or creek strip ("between the midline of Farms Road and the midline of Dale Road").
- `geometry.steps`: for metes and bounds only, one step per "commencing" or "thence" clause, in order: `start`, `direction` (the direction words), `follow` (what the line follows), `feature` (the named feature), `side_or_bank`, `until` (the next landmark), `distance` (any stated distance, as written), and `quote` (the full clause).

Rules:

1. Every field you fill must have an entry in `quotes`: `field` is the field path (`effect`, `within`, `geometry.road`, `geometry.buffer_m`, `geometry.from`, `geometry.to`, `geometry.feature`, `geometry.side`, `period`, `exemptions[0]`, …) and `quote` is the shortest run of words from the text, copied exactly, that supports it. A field whose quote is not found in the text is thrown away.
2. Never write coordinates, bearings you computed, or place names that are not in the text.
3. Leave a field null when the text does not settle it, and add its path to `uncertain`. An empty answer with a clear `uncertain` list is better than a guess.
4. Do not decide whether the area is safe to shoot in, and do not summarise. Return only the JSON.

Schedule 5 No Shooting Areas (Section 6)
Roberts Bank Superport and Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal Causeways
130 Those portions of British Columbia in the Municipality of Delta, within the following described boundaries: (1)Commencing at the point of intersection of the centerline of 27B Avenue, also referred to as Deltaport Way, and the western flood protection dyke at the northerly extremity of the Roberts Bank Superport Causeway; thence northwesterly along the high water mark of the dyke for a distance of 150 metres measured in a straight line perpendicular to the axis of the causeway at that point; thence parallel to the high water mark contour of the banks of the Roberts Bank Superport Causeway and loading pods at a distance 150 m seaward of the high water mark, measured in a straight line perpendicular to the axis of the causeway, in southwesterly and northwesterly directions to a point 150 metres south of the high water mark of the southernmost extremity of the Deltaport loading pods of the Terminal; thence northeasterly in a straight line to the most southerly of the two navigation towers located approximately 750 metres offshore from the south side of the causeway; thence, in a straight line, following a line perpendicular to the axis of the causeway and being the shortest distance to the causeway at that point, to a point 150 metres southeast of the high water mark of the south shore of the causeway, measured in a straight line perpendicular to the axis of the causeway at that point; thence in a northeasterly direction, seaward and parallel to the contour of the high water mark of the causeway, to a point on the high water mark of the western flood protection dyke 150 metres southeast of the high water mark of the causeway; thence, following the high water mark of the dyke to the point of intersection of the center line of 27B Avenue and the western flood protection dyke, being the point of commencement, and (2)Commencing at the extreme southernmost corner of the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve; thence in a straight line in a southerly direction, to a point on the high water mark of the western flood protection dyke located 150 metres in a southeasterly direction perpendicular from the high water mark of the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal Causeway; thence following a line seaward and parallel to the high water mark contours of the causeway and terminal loading pod, which is 150 metres southeast of the high water mark and being the shortest distance to the high water mark at any point, in a southwesterly direction, to a point located 150 metres seaward and southeast of the high water mark of the extreme southernmost point of the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal loading pod; thence in a straight line in a southeasterly direction, to the easternmost point on the southern edge of the wave protection rock wall; thence to the extreme westernmost end of the wave protection rock wall, being marked by a navigation light beacon; thence in a northwesterly direction, following the line of navigation light beacon towers to the beacon tower located immediately southwest of the westernmost point of the terminal loading pod; thence in a straight line to a point perpendicular to the axis of the causeway at any point, to the intersection of the westerly boundary of the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve; thence in a southerly direction for approximately 350 metres following the westerly boundary of the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve, to the extreme southwesterly corner of the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve, being the point of commencement.
