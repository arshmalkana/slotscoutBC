# Extraction task dm_notice-d51d9aaf4efa (run 1)

Write your answer to `queue/answers/run1/dm_notice-d51d9aaf4efa.json` as:

```json
{ "task_id": "dm_notice-d51d9aaf4efa", "run": 1, "mode": "agent", "model": "Claude Code agent mode", "prompt_version": "dm_notice.v1", "schema_id": "dm_notice.v1", "produced_at": "<ISO time>", "answer": { ...matching schema/dm_notice.v1.json... } }
```

The answer must match `schema/dm_notice.v1.json` exactly. Use only the source text below and the page images listed. Never write coordinates. Every filled field needs its exact quote.

## Instructions

# dm_notice.v1

You read one document linked from a British Columbia natural resource district road safety page: a District Manager closure order, a notice that rescinds one, a gate location map, a road restriction bulletin, a deactivation notice, or something else (an inspection report, a news release, a flyer). Return every road it closes, restricts, gates or deactivates, in the JSON schema `dm_notice.v1`. Code places km points on the official road line; a person checks every reading before it counts on the map.

You get:

- the document's text: its text layer, followed by text read by OCR from pages that are pictures (each OCR page starts with `[Page N: text read by OCR from the page image]`);
- when the PDF has map or scan pages, images of those pages.

Read only this document. Do not use anything you know about the road from elsewhere.

How to use the page images:

- Read printed words the text missed: road names, file and section numbers, km labels, "Gate", "Closed", "Deactivated", legends and titles.
- See what the map marks: a gate symbol on a road, a stretch drawn as closed or deactivated, a closure point.
- Never write coordinates, never measure distances from the map or its scale, and never say where something is except by the words printed on the map. If the map marks a gate or closure with no km label, give the point with `km` null and `extent` `unknown`, and describe the mark in `map_readings`.

How to fill the fields:

- `legible`: false only if neither the text nor the images can be read at all; then leave `roads` empty and add `roads` to `uncertain`.
- `document_type`: what the document is.
- `signed_on`: the date it was signed or issued, as YYYY-MM-DD, or null.
- `rescinded`: true only if the document rescinds, lifts or cancels a closure, or says the road has reopened.
- `roads`: one entry per road the document closes, restricts, gates or deactivates (none for a document that closes nothing), with:
  - `name` as written, `file_section` ("5748.01", or the road file number such as "FSR 5833" written as "5833") or null, and `quote`: the exact words that name the road, from the text or printed on the map;
  - `effective_from` and `effective_to` as YYYY-MM-DD, or null;
  - `points`: one entry per km point or stretch, with `km`, `km_end`, `extent` (`at`, `beyond`, `range`, `whole_road`, `unknown`), `status` (`closed`, `restricted`, `gated`, `washout`, `bridge_out`, `deactivated`, `caution`), `seen_on` (`text` or `map`) and `quote`: the full sentence from the text, or the label printed on the map exactly as printed. A road closed with no km point gets one point with `km` null and `extent` `whole_road` or `unknown`.
- `map_readings`: for each marked place on a map page, the page number, the words printed there, and what the map shows there in plain words.

Rules:

1. Every filled top-level field (`signed_on`, `rescinded`) needs an entry in `quotes` with the exact words it came from. Each road and each point carries its own `quote`. Quotes are checked against the text and the OCR text; a value whose quote is not found is not counted, and a person checks it on the image instead.
2. Never write coordinates or place km points yourself.
3. If you cannot tell a point's status, use the stricter reading only if the document supports it; otherwise leave the point out and add the road's `points` to `uncertain`.
4. Return only the JSON.

## Page images

Open each image with the Read tool and look at it before answering. Read the words printed on the map; never write coordinates or measure from the map.
